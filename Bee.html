  <p>Bees are flying insects closely related to wasps and ants<br>
  Bees are a monophyletic lineage within the superfamily Apoidea and <br>
  are presently considered a clade, called Anthophila. There are nearly 20,000 known <br>
  species of bees in seven recognized biological families.They are found on <br>
  every continent except Antarctica, in every habitat on the planet that <br>
  contains insect-pollinated flowering plants.</p>
  <h3> What do bees do for us? </h3>
  <p>insects actually make it possible for many of your favorite foods <br>
  to reach your table. From apples to almonds to the pumpkin in our<br>
pumpkin pies, we have bees to thank. They transfer pollen and seeds from one<br>
 flower to another, fertilizing the plant so it can grow and produce food. <br>
 Cross-pollination helps at least 30 percent of the world's crops and 90 <br>
 percent of our wild plants to thrive.They are responsible for much of the <br>
 food on your plate. Bees perform a task that is vital to the survival <br>
 of agriculture: pollination. In fact, one third of our global <br>
 food supply is pollinated by bees. </p>
 <h3> Can we live without them? </h3> 
 <p>To put this into context, these are many of the crops pollinated <br>
 by bees: Almonds, apples, apricots, avocados, blueberries, cantaloupes,<br>
  cashews, coffee, cranberries, cucumbers, eggplants, grapes, kiwis, <br>
  mangoes, okra, peaches, pears, peppers, strawberries, tangerines,<br>
walnuts and watermelons.Without bees, these crops would cease <br>
to exist. Bees are crucial to our existence as well, <br>
thus we must work harder to protect and preserve them.</p>
