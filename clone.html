  <p> One student wanted more people to understand the significance of bees to <br>
  human life -- so she created what's essentially a "bee drone" to be a <br>
  functional teaching tool that couples technology and design.</p>
  <h3> What is the Bee Drone? </h3>
  <p> Plan Bee is a personal robotic bee, controlled by a <br>
  smart device designed to mimic how bees pollinate flowers<br>
   and crops. Similar to how bees transfer pollen from one flower<br>
to another, the drone sucks in pollen from a plant and <br>
expels it onto other flowers to enable cross-pollination.<br>
the Plan Bee prototype, a hand-sized yellow-and-black<br>
device that looks nothing like a bee. She wanted to<br>
give it the essence of a bee without exactly<br>
replicating the insect.The device is made<br>
with a foam core (to keep it lightweight), plastic-shell<br>
body and a pair of propellers to keep it airborne.<br>
Each of the drone's six sections has tiny holes underneath <br>
through which the device sucks in pollen from a flower <br>
when it hovers over it. The pollen is stored in the <br>
body cavity before it's later expelled for cross-pollination.</p>
